            <p> Hi, Iâ€™m Karin (Ka-reen) and my biggest passion is creating. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor in Architecture Degree from Woodbury University. I am excited about designing captivating and sustainable human experiences. With a background in robotics, I am always looking for new materials, digital fabrication methods, and ways of integrating technology into architecture. My hobbies include 3D-printing, sewing, watercolor, and walking my dog.  </p>
